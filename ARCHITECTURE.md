# 🏗️ Game Refactor Architecture Documentation

## **Overview**

This document explains how the complex, monolithic game logic from the original `app.js` (1627 lines) has been refactored into a clean, maintainable, and testable.

## **🏛️ Architecture Principles Applied**

### **1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
Each service class has **one clear purpose** and **one reason to change**.

### **2. Separation of Concerns (SoC)**
Game logic is separated into distinct domains with clear boundaries.

### **3. Dependency Injection (DI)**
Services receive their dependencies through constructors, making them testable and loosely coupled.

### **4. Interface Segregation**
Each service exposes only the methods it needs, not bloated interfaces.

## **📊 Before vs After Comparison**

| Aspect | **Before (Monolithic)** | **After (Modular)** |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **File Size** | 1627 lines in `app.js` | 50-200 lines per service |
| **Responsibilities** | Mixed concerns | Single responsibility per service |
| **Testing** | Impossible to unit test | Each service testable independently |
| **Maintenance** | Hard to navigate and modify | Easy to locate and change functionality |
| **Scalability** | Difficult to scale | Services scale independently |
| **Team Development** | Merge conflicts, unclear ownership | Clear ownership, reduced conflicts |

## **🔗 Service Dependencies & Communication**

    A[GameManager] --> B[RoomManager]
    A --> C[GameFlowManager]
    A --> D[RoundManager]
    A --> E[GameStateManager]
    A --> F[ParticipantManager]
    
    C --> D
    D --> E
    B --> E
    
    G[Socket.IO] --> A
    H[Express] --> A
    I[Database] --> B
```

### **Dependency Flow**:
1. **GameManager** receives all socket events
2. **GameManager** delegates to appropriate service
3. **Services communicate** through well-defined interfaces
4. **Database operations** are centralized in RoomManager
5. **Socket emissions** are coordinated through GameManager

## **🧪 Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing**:
- Each service can be tested **independently**
- Dependencies are **mocked** for isolation
- Business logic is **testable** without infrastructure

### **Integration Testing**:
- Services can be tested **together** with real dependencies
- Game flow can be tested **end-to-end**
- Database operations can be **verified**

### **Example Test Structure**:
```javascript
// RoomManager.test.js
describe('RoomManager', () => {
  let roomManager;
  let mockIO;
  let mockConfig;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockIO = { /* mock socket.io */ };
    mockConfig = { /* mock config */ };
    roomManager = new RoomManager(mockIO, mockConfig);
  });

  describe('createNewRoom', () => {
    it('should create room with correct game flows', async () => {
      // Test room creation logic
    });
  });
});
```
